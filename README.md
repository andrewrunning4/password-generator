# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## My Result

I believe I got all of the criteria for acceptance. It will ask for how many characters you want, then if you want numbers, special characters, uppercase letters and lowercase letters. If you dont choose a number in range, it will alert to pick a proper number. If you don't choose any characters, it will tell you that you have to choose somthing. It prints the generated password so it can be copied.
